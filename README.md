# 🧠 Fossil Logic Community

Welcome to the official community space for the **Fossil Logic ecosystem** — a collection of portable, lightweight, and open-source C, C++, Python libraries for modern systems programming. This repository hosts **GitHub Discussions** where developers, learners, and contributors come together to ask questions, share insights, and collaborate on making code great again.

## 🚀 What's Fossil Logic?

Fossil Logic is a modular ecosystem that includes:

- 🧩 **Fossil SDK** – portable systems libraries for I/O, networking, file systems, and more  
- 🐚 **Jellyfish AI** – shell-first AI architecture inspired by simplicity and resilience  
- 🦀 **Blue CrabDB** – lightweight, file-based key-value storage built for embedded or CLI systems
- 🐢 **Turtal Tools** - command-line applications created by Fossil Logic
- 🧪 Tools for **unit testing**, **data structures**, **security**, and **low-level debugging**
